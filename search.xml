Without constant sending and feedback in communication, the parties will not be able to understand and respond appropriately to the idea of the others and thus, cannot co-operate. Without good communication, there will be no teamwork in the workplace and there sure to be misunderstandings and conflict. The video below is a comical example of how language barrier in communication and assumptions might lead to a whole lot of misunderstanding.</p><p>Ineffective communication is seen as a problems cause by different ‘barriers’. Those barriers includes:</p><p>Physical distraction: The elements of the surrounding such as poor lighting, background noises, atmosphere, etc can really drive off your focus span during communication.</p><p>Attitude: If you feel strong emotions like angered or unhappy, you will most likely feel uncomfortable to listen or even speak with someone. This will not only halt the effectiveness of your communication but also make you less productive and co-operative. Emotions can also interfere with your confidence in facing others and thus, make you less of a dependable person in other’s eyes.</p><p>Channel barriers: How you channel your message is very important. For example: If you are trying to send instruction to someone, it would be more ideal to have it in written form rather than telling them verbally, or else it would be difficult to follow through. People who are unaware of how they should communicate could get in a lot of problem.</p><p>Stereotype: When you have stereotypical thoughts about someone base on their background and culture, it would be hard for you to communicate effectively as you won’t have enough trust in them. Holding stereotypical thoughts about someone else who simply put a barrier between you and them.</p><p>Language barrier: In communication, language barriers can happen anytime. Everyone have their own mother tongue language as well as their own interpretation of certain words and phrases. Thus, conflicting language might occur and the communicators might not be able to understand each other.  </p><p>Time barrier: Let say you complete a great design for a new car and you wanted to report it to your boss, when will it be better to tell him? Midnight right after you finish your design? or next morning when your boss is at work? Choosing when to approach a person to discuss something with them is very important because if you do not choose the appropriate time, the person whom you are trying to deliver the message to might not be interested in listening to you.</p><p>Structural problems in the organization: If the structure in an organization is unclear, then members of the organisation might have problems communicating as they don’t know who and when to communicate. New members should be instructed clearly  to prevent any communication mishap or confusion.  </p><p>Lack of knowledge on the subjects: Lack of understanding on the subject would make communication difficult for both the sender and the receiver. Usually, people communicate easier when the subject of matter is something that both of them are familiar with. If the sender is not sure about the matter he is communicating, then the receiver would be troubled in understanding as well.</p><p>Information overload: Processing information takes time and if communication does not goes at a pace where both parties can have enough time to carry out their thought process, then it will cause communication breakdown as concentration and interest might be haltered.</p><p>Assumptions: Assuming something without clarification is a very dangerous thing to do. When you assume the wrong information, it is very likely that you will make wrong decisions and conclusion. This could cause many extended problems and lead to conflicts as well.</p><p>(Source: Effectivecommunicationadvice / marin.edu / CTE)</p><p>How to overcome communication barriers?</p><p><img src="https://maxcommunicationmotivation.weebly.com/uploads/1/5/6/8/15680400/5699859.jpg" alt=""></p><p>Communication barriers are not impossible to overcome at all. They can be avoided if you know how to deal with them correctly. Here are some advice for you to overcome these problems</p><p>Be attentive: of who you are communicating with. If they have trouble getting your message, you should know how to adjust your communication method in order to get through with them.</p><p>Be patience: is the key to effective communication. You must never rush anything and take your time in order to make communication work thoroughly between you can your partner</p><p>Never assume: because you could interpretative the foul information and carry out wrong decisions or responds. Always clarify something if you are unclear.</p><p>Be friendly and open-minded: towards others you are co-operating with. You must never judge others or let your feelings towards someone interfere with your work. Also, you must be emphatic towards other to work out the problem rather than just let things be. Workplace often encourage those who co-operate well with others no matter what.  </p><p>Be aware: of who you are communicating with and how you should communicate with them. This would help you approach that person and approach in a better manner and style and prevent and problems that might occur.</p><h3 id="Types-of-communication"><a href="#Types-of-communication" class="headerlink" title="Types of communication"></a>Types of communication</h3><p>Learn about the various way we use to communicate.</p><p>Types of communications<br>Nowadays, we are exposed to many form of communications such as:<br>All of these mentioned form of communication and many more can be classified into 2 different categories</p><ol><li>Verbal communication</li><li>Non-verbal communication<br>Verbal communication</li></ol><p><img src="https://maxcommunicationmotivation.weebly.com/uploads/1/5/6/8/15680400/7681958.jpg?150" alt=""><br>Verbal communication is the type of communication that involved communicating verbally using language that the sender and the receiver understand.It is meant to be done so that the sender and the receiver are able to understand each other effectively. There are two types of verbal communication: Oral communication and written communication.</p><ul><li>Oral communication<br>Oral communication involve communicating orally via spoken words. Many examples of oral communication is face    to face talking, phone, radio, television and any forms of communication that deliver the message to the receiver’s ears. In oral communication, factors such as tone, speed, volume and confidence can affect its effectiveness.</li></ul><p>Oral communication is very convenience as it can be perform very quickly and it allows sender to receive feedback faster. The sender are also able to express their feelings through verbal communication and bring certain mood effect to the receiver. In face-to-face communication, the speaker can also observe the other person’s expression and decide how to respond accordingly. Verbal communication can become an useful way to motivate others if you have the right skill and confidence</p><p>However, oral communication can become unsuccessful if external factors are encountered such as loud noise background or physical disturbance which could interrupt speaking. Oral communication cannot be done with a person who is either deaf, mute or does not speak the same language.In face-to-face communication, the communicator have to think of what to say while interpret what they heard which could cause them confusion and fail to communicate wisely. This could be worsen if that person lack confidence or communication skill.</p><ul><li>Written communication<br>Written communication involve composing the message in a written format and deliver it via soft copy or hard copy.This type of communication can be seen with the use of fax, text messages, social network, e-mail, etc. Written communication is influence by the structure of the language such as grammar and vocabulary.</li></ul><p>Written communication is an important skill applied in the business environment. It is very important as it can be use to compose a lot of information together, save into many copies and deliver to many people at once.Written information can be recorded and stored for later study which can be useful to manage and organize detailed and mass information. The receiver will be able to understand the message more thoroughly as well.</p><p>However, written communication does not bring instant feedback like verbal communication do. It also requires good writing skill and time to compose the message and it could be a challenge to those who lack writing skill. Written communication allows people to compose more information and tend to lead to information overload.People who are blind are unable to communicate by writing.</p><p>(Source: Notes Desk)</p><p>Non-verbal communication</p><p><img src="https://maxcommunicationmotivation.weebly.com/uploads/1/5/6/8/15680400/5264329.jpg" alt=""><br>Non-verbal communication refers to any other form of communication that does not involve writing, talking or use of words and languages. Body language such as posture, facial expression, hand movements, tone, etc are all consider non-verbal communication. It is a way of communicating messages or rather command without using words. The receiver will have to base on their own interpretation to understand the message and thus, the sender must be able to give clear signals. Non-verbal communication is very important as performing it effectively will decide how comfortable and attentive the other person feel about communicating with you.</p><p>Non verbal communication has 3 main elements:</p><p>Appearance: How the speaker appears will decide how interested the listeners will be. In a workplace, a person with professional look and confident appearance will surely catch the attention of many. External factor such as room light, temperature and noise level will also influence the appearance of a conversation</p><p>Body language: There are many things that accounted to body language include hand signals, posture and facial expressions. When combine well in verbal communication, these body language could help emphasize the effectiveness of delivering the message.</p><p>Sounds: Speaking fluently with good tone, clear voice and normal speed could help verbal communication a lot more effective.  </p><p>(Source: Notes Desk)</p><p>Visual communication<br><img src="https://maxcommunicationmotivation.weebly.com/uploads/1/5/6/8/15680400/9058027.jpg?181" alt=""><br>It is always said that ‘a picture worth a thousand words’. Visual aids are always important in communication as it will act as an illustration for the receiver to understand the message a lot faster and easier. In business presentation, the presenter are often accompanied by powerpoint slides or videos to help them get the message across easily without having to say too much. Visual communication relies on the ability to interpret images by the audience. Thus, if we are not careful with the images we choose, we could easily make the audience interpret the wrong message. In our daily life, we could see visual communication everywhere in the public such as banners, signboards, traffic light, maps and etc. Traffic light gives command to vehicle users by flickering lights signalling the action they should take like red for stop and green for go.</p><p>(Source: Managementstudyguide)</p><p>Understand formal and informal communication</p><p><img src="https://maxcommunicationmotivation.weebly.com/uploads/1/5/6/8/15680400/6702327.jpg?206" alt=""><br>Different type of communications are used depend on the situations. Certain form of communication can be useful and appropriate for certain use but it will not be consider ethical. For example: When a staff want to report to his boss, he will have to write a proper grammar using professional language and realistic data. He would be fired if he posted a note on his boss’ Facebook page because it is not professional and since Facebook is a social network place that is not very suitable for work discussion.</p><p> +Formal communication<br>Formal communication refers to appropriate and professional style of communication that is used in business workplace. A person who needs to communicate formally requires to follow standard rules and outlines set by the higher authority. In formal communication, correct grammar and pronunciation are required while slang and foul language should be avoided at all cost as we used it to communicate with our co-operatives and people of higher rank. Thus, professionalism and formalism always come first.</p><p> +Informal communication<br>Informal communication refers to a more free and comfortable style of communication as the communicator is allow to communicate in anyway they wish. In informal communication, there are no standard and limits to how one should use their language, thus, make it easier for communicator to communicate. In our daily life, we used informal communication with our friends and family as a more natural way of communication have people express themselves better and build better relationship. Thus, practicing informal communication in workplace to create a friendlier environment is not something wrong but should rather be done as long as it has a limit to it.</p><p>(Source: Notes Desk)</p><h3 id="Communication-in-business"><a href="#Communication-in-business" class="headerlink" title="Communication in business"></a>Communication in business</h3><p>Look into how communication flow in the business world.</p><p>Communication in business - How does it go?<br>To begin with, let’s go through some basic concepts about communication in business. A business is structured using a hierarchical structure where each member would have responsible over other member of lower rank. The purpose of this hierarchical structure is to maintain a firm order and rule within a business and ensure that everyone within the organisation co-operate and communicate effectively.There are two main types of organisational structure: Tall structure and flat structure. Let’s look at the graph below</p><p><img src="https://maxcommunicationmotivation.weebly.com/uploads/1/5/6/8/15680400/4449028_orig.gif" alt=""><br>Diagram of tall and flat organisational structure<br>Organisation A is a tall organisational structure. In a tall structure, there are various levels of hierarchical ranking and thus, it has a long chain of command through the many layers from the highest (CEO) to lowest (employees). With the many layers, each manager will only have control over a limited number of employee, thus, they will have smaller span of control. Tall organisation structure is often applied in large companies where there are more members within the organisation itself.</p><p>Organisation B is a flat organisational structure. In a flat structure, there are lesser layers of hierarchical ranking and thus, make the chain of command shorter. Since there are lesser layers of authority, a manager would have more span of control since they will have to be in charge of more employees. Flat organisations are often embodied within small organisations owned by an individual sole trader where there are fewer employees.</p><p>By looking at the example of an organisational chart below, you would be able to understand how the hierarchical system work overall. The managing director sit on top and take charge of all the other directors while each directors take care of the team leaders who were assigned to keep an eye out for the teams. But, how do they communicate with each other?</p><p><img src="https://maxcommunicationmotivation.weebly.com/uploads/1/5/6/8/15680400/4724169_orig.gif" alt=""><br>Example of an organisational chart<br>In a business organisation, communication goes in an order and not simply from one person to another. Communication in business is perform in a very mannered way. For examples, Production Team Members cannot simply report to the Managing Director who is on the top. They can only report to the Managing Director after they have reported to the Production Team Leaders who will report to the Operations Director to the Managing Director. This is known as Vertical Communication, communication between members of different ranks. On the other hand, communication between members of the same rank is know as Horizontal Communication. Communication between members is known as Internal Communication while communicating with people outside of the business organisation such as suppliers or customers are called External Communication. Within communication in a organization, vertical communication must be made very clear to everyone or else there will be a big communication breakdown between managers and employees. Vertical communication ensures that there are co-operation and understanding among people in the organisation. Horizontal communication is as important except one should see it more than a working ethic along. Communicating with your partners in work help you works better as a team. But, at the same time, you should also bear in mind that it is an opportunity for you to build your relationship with your peer.</p><p>In business, communication is very important. It plays a role in helping everyone in the organisation co-operate with each other and connect with customers and other partnered organisations as well. One who work in business need to have good communication skills in both oral and written. At all time, their communication must be formal and professional. Not only should you talk to deliver information and send feedback, you must also speak up in a way that other listen and empathize with you. But at the same time, you must be able to listen with what other have to say as well to maintain a balance two-ways communication.</p><p>We must keep in mind that in business, communication will determine how successful you are in the workplace.</p><p>Source: Cambridge IGCSE Business Studies Textbook 2nd Edition)</p><h3 id="How-it-affect-motivation"><a href="#How-it-affect-motivation" class="headerlink" title="How it affect motivation?"></a>How it affect motivation?</h3><p>Giving you a detailed view on the matter.</p><p>How does communication affect motivation?<br>Before discussing this topic, I would like you to watch this very motivational speech made by Steve Job, the founder of Apple Inc at Stanford University on 12 June, 2006. See for yourself how he brought motivation upon the many students of Stanford as well as many who have watched this video and you.  </p><p>If you have watch the full video, I believe you felt enlightened and motivated by this speech yourself. Motivational speaker such as Steve Job or Barack Obama are not rare at all. In fact, you probably know such people from your daily life experience as well. These motivational speakers have a great way to get others inspired. They are able to attract the attention of others and turn everything they said into an empowerment to the listeners. But, why do people like Steve Jobs want to motivates people?</p><p>In business, knowing how to communicate effectively in order to inspire the employees is a job that many managers are trying to achieve. The reason is simple: motivation eventually lead to more productivity. Motivation in workplace is often triggered when the managers find his way of speaking to his employee. Effective communication by the managers will result in changing the mood within the co-operate and inspire employees to work harder towards common goals. Not only so, a motivated group of people tend to have more co-operation among each other, which will result in more encouraged better teamwork and better outcomes. On the other hand, an article on Love2Reward said that 91% of companies with internal communication problems tend to find motivation at low level.</p><p>Motivation at workplace heavily depends on how the manager influence his workers. It is for a fact that employee feel more enthusiastic to work when they have a proactive leader who pay attentions to the workers. Manager who try to communicate effective by being friendly instead of trying to be the boss often win the employee over easier. This will not only make sure that communication will be channel effectively as the emotional barrier is eliminate and the managers and employee build a stronger bond. When employee feel that their boss is friendly and pay respect them, they will feel more comfortable and motivated to work.</p><p>All it takes for a leader to deliver a motivational speech is to be confidence. As you have observed from the Steve Job speech video, you could see that he comfortably spoke in front of many people. He spoke with a very calm tone and a lot of emotion expression it it. He even make jokes like at 04:40 where he said Microsoft copied Apple. Then, as he continued with his stories, he delivered some inspirational messages such as “you gotta ind what you love to do” (8:24) or “keep looking, don’t settle” (8:39). At the end of the video, you could see how many Stanford graduate has become as they clapped and cheer for him. Being motivational speaker is not difficult at all. It just require good, persuasive communication skills and confidence to speak out the message. When the message is delivered successfully, people are inspired and motivated.</p><p>In conclusion, motivation comes from a positive environment in the workplace and communication can do so. By channeling communication effectively within the organisation, managers and employee are not being shunned by the communication barriers such as emotion or structural problem, thus, lead to stronger bonds and co-operation. This will allow manager to interact more with their employees and be attentive to them. As this happen, employees will feel respected by their manager and felt more motivated to do work. In addition, managers who want to motivate their employee have to have confidence. They must be able to communicate to their employee with confidence and comfort, creating a close feeling between him and his employees while also draw out important inspirational messages. In today’s world, professionalism is very important in workplace, but ensure that workers are motivated to work is much more important as it will create the desire to aim for success and result in higher productivity and outcomes. That’s why communication should be practice effectively.  </p><p><img src="https://maxcommunicationmotivation.weebly.com/uploads/1/5/6/8/15680400/854441.jpg?466" alt=""><br>Let’s aim toward a motivated working environment !</p>]]></content>

It doesn’t help you. It doesn’t help your relationship. It’s not going to stop anything; as a matter of fact it will probably only make something happen. Men are like children in some respects. When we were kids and our parents or teachers told us not to do something, it only made us want to do it more. The best thing you can do in a relationship is give the other person freedom. This is for two reasons: first, if someone wants to step out on you they are going to step out and there is nothing you can do. Better to find out early and be done. Second, men are attracted to confidence ( at least men worth being with ) &amp; there is nothing more attractive than a confident woman who is confident in the relationship. It’s no fun being in a relationship and listening to insecurities. BIG turn off. With Lauryn, she is not the jealous type. I have never been tempted to step out or cheat. A lot of that has to do with me and integrity…but a big part is her attitude. <strong>She doesn’t care if I go out with friends, she’s not looking through my phone or e-mails. She just trusts me and in turn, that makes me trust her. She’s too busy to be wasting time on worry &amp; jealousy.

Downsizing is tough on those let go, but it also places additional demands on those still on the job and leaves them wondering if they might be next.<br>When technology builds an electronic brick wall between people. A person receives a less-than-friendly e-mail and rather than taking the time to cool down first, fires off an angry response, starting a chain of angry e-mails.<br>If you had a blood pressure cuff on people at the time these situations happened, you’d see their readings increase— sometimes dramatically. In each case, it’s easy to imagine the stress level in the office or between the people involved sky-rocketing. Unfortunately, the resultant stress increases the odds for rudeness to occur, and that can lead to the stress/rudeness vicious circle.</p><p>The vicious circle begins when stress increases between people. As it increases, it leads to loss of awareness as the stressed person becomes more focused on him- or herself and not on how his or her actions are affecting others. In turn, that loss of awareness leads to actions that, at the very least, appear rude. The rudeness, in turn, ramps up the stress the affected people feel. And now all parties are ensnared in the stress/rudeness vicious circle.</p><p>Another stress factor is introduced when people act impulsively, doing the first thing that comes to mind without thinking about the consequences. For instance, Tom and Andy are having a conversation and Tom’s cell phone rings. Without thinking about the effect on Andy, Tom answers his phone, leaving Andy to think Tom is pretty rude. So Andy throws his hands up in disgust and walks away. Tom perceives Andy’s action as rude and way over the top and, suddenly, they became trapped in the stress/ rudeness vicious circle, all because of two impulsive actions: Tom answering his phone and Andy’s impulsive response to Tom’s action.</p><p>Had Tom stayed his hand for just a few seconds while his phone was ringing and focused on how answering it might be perceived by Andy, he might have chosen to send the call to voicemail. Andy would have noticed the action and instead of being frustrated with Tom, he would have appreciated the non-verbal signal that Tom considered their conversation to be more important than a phone call from who knows who.</p><p>By curbing the inclination to act impulsively, you can improve relationships and avoid entering the stress/rudeness vicious circle.</p><h2 id="3-Biblical-Truths-About-Envy-And-Jealousy"><a href="#3-Biblical-Truths-About-Envy-And-Jealousy" class="headerlink" title="3 Biblical Truths About Envy And Jealousy"></a><a href="https://theprayingwoman.com/3-biblical-truths-about-envy-and-jealousy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3 Biblical Truths About Envy And Jealousy</a></h2><p><img src="http://pd4vb8220.bkt.clouddn.com/jealousy20180908.jpg?imageMogr2/thumbnail/!75p" alt=""></p><ol><li>Jealousy can lead to your downfall.<br>For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice. – James 3:16</li></ol><p>“Oh, did you see … and …?” “Look at her, girl I’d love to have her… ”</p><p>Jealousy. In the bible, we see that Saul was jealous of David, but to note, Saul brought his troubles upon himself.</p><p>A tool created by the devil. Jealousy will cause people to act strange and even harm people to the point of death.</p><p>What those who have this spirit upon them fail to realize is that they have their own set of gifts and blessings that God has given them, so why envy someone else and their blessing?</p><p>Also, some people with this spirit feel threatened by someone who appears to be higher than them; notice I said appear.</p><p>Just because the gift may be wrapped with the finest wrapping paper and most beautiful bow, what it holds inside may be rotten to the core.</p><p>Jealous people often times feel insecure, powerless, and doubt themselves about getting what they are jealous about.</p><ol start="2"><li>Jealousy is more detrimental than wrath or anger.<br>Wrath is cruel, anger is overwhelming, but who can stand before jealousy? – Proverbs 27:4</li></ol><p>The spirit of jealousy is very detrimental among women, especially Christian woman.</p><p>Why can’t we just be happy and celebrate when our sister gets her blessing she’s been waiting/praying on, instead of eyeing her and making her uncomfortable because of the worldly way we may accuse of her getting her blessing.</p><p>If you have this spirit upon you, you may question or 2nd guess yourself and your abilities, again forgetting that what God has for you is for you along with YOUR OWN set of blessings.</p><p>Jealousy is of the flesh, and fleshy desires/acts never work out for the good of God.</p><p>Jealousy can have you so caught up that it could destroy your life, because you’re too busy noticing what she has while you could be losing everything.</p><p>When you recognize this spirit in your presence, remember you have the power of the Holy Spirit within you to overcome it; Call it out.</p><p>Move forward in Faith and ask for the covering of the Blood of Jesus. Remove yourself from that spirit and pray for that Sister.</p><p>Ask God to open her eyes so she can see her own blessings.</p><p>Show your Godly wisdom and discipline</p><p>If you feel you have this spirit upon you, STOP and REPENT!! Ask the Holy Spirit to come in and bind that spirit, so you can see your own blessings God has for you and has provided for you.</p><p>Submit to God. Have Faith and read the Word of God in the Bible. Once you are equipped with the armor of God, the attacks and spirits of jealousy will have a hard time entering your atmosphere.</p><ol start="3"><li>When you are content, you don’t have to be jealous.<br>Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. 12 I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need.  – Philippians 4:11-12</li></ol><p>Be content in everything God has provided for YOU! You have your own set of blessings!!</p><p>Sometimes we’re so busy counting everyone else’s blessings that we forget to count our own.</p><p>Keep your eyes on your prize!

These failures might make you feel worthless or useless.</p><p>After wallowing on your pain for a day or two, you should feel better to face another day. However, if the feelings of worthlessness is long overdue and is getting worse with the passing of days, it might indicate that you’re having an inferiority complex.</p><p>Inferiority complex prevents you from seeing your true worth and focus only on your flaws. It gives you a thousand reasons why you can’t do a thing rightly and why others perform better than you.</p><p>People having an inferiority complex think only of their weaknesses and see every situation through this lens.</p><p>Some root causes of an inferiority complex can also be traced through childhood experiences that leave a permanent dent in a child’s psyche. This child will grow up having self-doubt and feeling not good enough compared to other people.</p><p>Identifying the symptoms of an inferiority complex is the first step in overcoming it. Here are some of them and the ways to face them.</p><p>Symptoms of Inferiority Complex:</p><ol><li>You often have feelings of worthlessness.<br>Feelings of worthlessness commonly arise when you keep comparing yourself with others. You have this fixed notion that everyone you see has a better life, better qualities, and better skills than you are.</li></ol><p>You see others as entities who could never go wrong nor can have any bad days.</p><ol start="2"><li>You are overly sensitive to criticisms.<br>You react quickly every time you receive criticisms. Even the most constructive ones make you shrink and doubt your abilities.</li></ol><p>Because criticisms make you vulnerable, you choose not to say a word or do a thing.</p><ol start="3"><li>You have a preconceived idea that people don’t like you.<br>Even if you’re not sure what others are thinking, you imagine that others don’t like you. Or, if you’re about to meet people, you believe that they would have a negative judgment about you the moment they see you or come to know you.</li></ol><p>Thinking this way, you will behave in a way that others don’t approve of. Eventually, you repel others from liking you.</p><ol start="4"><li>You are submissive.<br>Because you don’t feel you’re good enough, you don’t have the strength to stand for yourself. You’re submissive to the whims of others to the point of being abused by them.</li></ol><p>Instead of finding your own voice, you settle for it as if it’s the lot life gives you.</p><ol start="5"><li>You are a perfectionist.<br>You believe that everything you do has to be perfect. Whenever you fail to do something perfectly, you see it as utter failure.</li></ol><p>Everything has to be flawless and must pass the high standards you have set upon.</p><p>Like any other personality problems, you can overcome inferiority complex by doing the inner work that helps you heal.</p><p>How To Overcome Inferiority Complex:Inferiority Complex 5 Ways How To Overcome It</p><p><img src="https://www.lifecoachcode.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/5-Symptoms-of-Inferiority-Complex-And-5-Ways-How-To-Overcome-It.jpg" alt=""></p><ol><li>Get inspiration from others instead of wanting to be like them.</li></ol><p>People are normal human beings who share the same traits as you. They also have pains, have soft spots, have rough edges, or might have been going through difficult times.</p><p>When you come to understand people, you will come to understand yourself.</p><p>Know the stories of great men and women. Their stories will give you light that you are more than what you think and your worth is more than you could ever imagine.</p><ol start="2"><li>Use criticism to your best advantage.</li></ol><p>Whether given in a positive or negative manner, you can use criticisms to your best advantage. See criticisms as a gauge of improving yourself and not a way to put you down.</p><p>Criticisms are hints that point you to the aspects of yourself that needs improvement.</p><ol start="3"><li>Be yourself and build self-confidence.</li></ol><p>Be the self that you want to be not the self that you think others might dislike. Begin by accepting yourself as you are.</p><p>By self-acceptance, you are giving others the reason to accept yourself too. Think and act in a manner that builds your confidence.</p><ol start="4"><li>Develop your own voice.</li></ol><p>Realize that you weren’t born to be a doormat other people have to step on. Find the inner strength and work on it until you’re able to stand on your own and defend yourself.</p><p>Stop your negative self-talk and start with the positive ones.</p><ol start="5"><li>Practice self help therapy.</li></ol><p>While seeking professional help is a common solution for perfectionism, self help therapy works equally good, as long as you’re determined enough to get the best out of it.</p><p>You can heal yourself by journaling, having self discipline, self monitoring, and being honest with yourself.</p><p>Keep in mind that you’re not sent into this world to be perfect; but to be happy, to live your best life, and make the small corner of your world a much better place because you’re a part of it.</p>]]></content>

To break the present situation, we must break through old thinking, old behavior and old habits.</p></blockquote><a id="more"></a><p><img src="http://pd4vb8220.bkt.clouddn.com/pastfuture20180816.JPG?imageMogr2/thumbnail/!75p" alt=""></p><h2 id="How-Do-We-Let-Go-of-the-Past"><a href="#How-Do-We-Let-Go-of-the-Past" class="headerlink" title="How Do We Let Go of the Past?"></a><a href="http://www.thepowerofoneness.com/blog/how-do-we-let-go-of-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How Do We Let Go of the Past?</a></h2><p>In order to heal our lives and move forward, we need to let go of the past.  How many times have we heard this statement?  Yet, most of us feel at least a little resistance at the thought of letting go of the past.  In truth, most people feel a great deal of reluctance to “let go of the past.”  </p><blockquote><p>Why do we resist?</p></blockquote><p>Many times we hold on to the past simply because we are afraid of change. We have an amazing propensity to hold onto the familiar–even if it is causing us harm.  How often have we clung to a destructive relationship, a job we have long outgrown, or even a consistently poor performing financial investment just because we are afraid of change?  <strong>Generally speaking our greatest fear is of the unknown.</strong></p><p> Since the very nature of life is change, we are powerless to remain in the status quo.  Our choice is to be victimized by the changes that are naturally evolving all around us or to make conscious choices that coincide with the quality of life we want to be living in present time.</p><blockquote><p>Isn’t it important to remember the past?</p></blockquote><p>Of course it is.  Healing our lives does not require that we forget the past. But remembering is not the same thing as becoming entrapped in old patterns of behavior simply because <strong>we are afraid to make changes</strong>. Past experiences, both positive and negative, serve us well when we learn from them and use these lessons as a springboard from which to launch new thought patterns that promote our health and growth.</p><p>What we need to let go of is our tendency to continue to focus on the painful memories of the past.  Since whatever we focus on is what we create, every time we give our attention to a painful situation from the past, we give our energy to repeating the same patterns of behavior.  For example, if you habitually focus on childhood abandonment, you are likely to find yourself in many relationships where you are abandoned.  Just as importantly, it is essential to realize that every time you focus your attention on painful memories of the past, you re-create the stressful mind and body responses that you associate with that memory, such as grief, depression, and heartache.  </p><blockquote><p>How Do We Let Go of the Past?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Forgive Yourself</strong> – Free yourself from your bondage to the past by forgiving yourself for the many choices you made that you now perceive as “mistakes.”  Sure, in retrospect, you might have done things differently.  Remember, you have gotten wiser with every experience you have had, so back then you didn’t have the same basis of knowledge that you now have.  </p><p><strong>Forgive The People Who Have Hurt You</strong> – Take back your power!  Every time you blame someone for painful experiences in the past you are allowing them to rule your thoughts!</p><p><strong>Be Conscious of Your Thinking</strong> – Become aware of when your thoughts are focused on negative past events and situations.  Simply acknowledging where you are giving your attention empowers you to return your thoughts to present time.</p><p><strong>Express gratitude for the lessons learned</strong> – Focus on how you have learned and grown with every experience you have had.</p><p><strong>Choose to be in present time</strong> – Savor every moment of your life journey.  Since the past is over and the future is not yet here, the only time that is “real” is NOW.   </p><p>Where you are in life right now is the result of your thoughts from the past.  Being fully present empowers you to <strong>make new choices</strong> that can change your reality.  In fact, whatever you are thinking in this moment is creating your future!</p><p>Love and Light,</p><p>Sandra</p>]]></content>

They give grand advice, and they give some useful tips. The most common grand advice they give is for you <a href="http://time.com/4845150/chief-justice-john-roberts-commencement-speech-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to be yourself</a>. It is an odd piece of advice to give people dressed identically, but you should — you should be yourself. But you should understand what that means. Unless you are perfect, it does not mean don’t make any changes. In a certain sense, you should not be yourself. You should try to become something better. People say ‘be yourself’ because they want you to resist the impulse to conform to what others want you to be. But you can’t be yourself if you don’t learn who are, and you can’t learn who you are unless you think about it.</p><p>The Greek philosopher Socrates said, ‘The unexamined life is not worth living.’ And while ‘just do it’ might be a good motto for some things, it’s not a good motto when it’s trying to figure out how to live your life that is before you. And one important clue to living a good life is to not to try to live the good life. The best way to lose the values that are central to who you are is frankly not to think about them at all.</p><h2 id="Critical-Thinking"><a href="#Critical-Thinking" class="headerlink" title="Critical Thinking"></a>Critical Thinking</h2><h2 id="Deliberate-Practice"><a href="#Deliberate-Practice" class="headerlink" title="Deliberate Practice"></a>Deliberate Practice</h2><h2 id="Experience"><a href="#Experience" class="headerlink" title="Experience"></a>Experience</h2><p><img src="http://pd4vb8220.bkt.clouddn.com/JohnRoberts20180812.webp?imageMogr2/thumbnail/!75p" alt=""></p><blockquote><p>‘I Wish You Bad Luck.’ Read Supreme Court Justice John Roberts’ <a href="http://time.com/4845150/chief-justice-john-roberts-commencement-speech-transcript/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unconventional Speech</a> to His Son’s Graduating Class</p></blockquote><p>From time to time in the years to come, I hope you will be treated <strong>unfairly</strong>, so that you will come to know the value of <strong>justice</strong>.
